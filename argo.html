    <h3><b>With:</b> Ishan Shah, Sneha Karkala, Jessica Cui, and Jake Warren <br>
            <b>Assignment focus:</b> improving the high-end gardening experience, with respect to air in the garden. <br>
            <b>My roles:</b> creative direction, interaction design, concept art</h3> <br>
        <p> For argodesign’s Center for Integrated Design course, we worked for a real argodesign client looking to deliver a more appealing gardening experience for the high-end consumer market. We were given a 5-week assignment, in which we were to spend one week on each of the following: communicating, where we familiarized ourselves with the team and the assignment; sensing, where we did our due diligence on the industry; thinking, where we identified and analyzed our ideas; making, where we began the prototypes; and finally, communicating, where we ultimately told the story about how our product can improve the gardening experience. </p>
        <h6> OUR BRIEF: “Our client seeks to provide sustainable, beautiful, high-end solutions to dedicated consumers  who value their outdoor spaces.” </h6>
        <img src="images/argo/mind%20map.png" alt="argo mind map"/>
        <p class="p1">Since none of us were gardeners ourselves, we needed to get a better idea of what gardeners need and want. To do this, we did a few user interviews and conducted a field observation in a community garden.<br />Our first interviewee was a student at UT Austin, who grows a variety of flowers, herbs, and vines on his balcony. Our second interviewee was Jessica&rsquo;s coworker, who has a garden backyard. We also noticed that, in the community garden, some plants were thriving while others withered in the Texas heat.</p>
<p class="p1"><br /><em><strong> &emsp; &ldquo;I just move the pots around...I could set up a screen, probably should, but I was too lazy. There are a lot of plants that require slightly [different] climates, but I can&rsquo;t do much about it&rdquo; &mdash; UT Student</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><br /><em><strong> &emsp; &ldquo;Thrips and sudden cold fronts. Thrips hide in flowers and are near impossible to kill off... last winter we had 20-30 degree drops within an hour and the shock killed half my garden in no time (traumatic)&rdquo; &mdash; Avid Gardener</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><br />Out of the pain points we found, we decided to focus on the common issue of flexibility: the climate and environment change at non-optimal cycles for sensitive plants in terms of sun exposure, wind, and temperature.</p>

<h6> Beginning to ideate: </h6>
        
<p>In an ongoing sketchbook, we documented a wide range of ideas, including bug repellent, pollen tracking, floor fan and ventilation, air quality sensor, energy generation, and many more ultimately rejected pitches.
    <br><br>
  One of our first ideas was a mini-incubator, since not only was it relevant to the element of "air", it also touched on a lot of the pain points: easily harmed saplings in sunoptimal climates and overexposure to environmental factors like sun, humidity, and even pests. In order to narrow down our ideas, we voted on feasibility, importance to the consumer, and our personal interest. In the end, we landed on the mini-incubator. 
        <img src="images/argo/sketches.jpg" alt="sketches"/>
        <p>After narrowing our options down to an incubator that would help with garden survival rates, we began to iterate on different shapes, sizes, and features. Our product offers the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle; line-height: 1.5em;">
<li>Ability to control the level of shade and light with an adjustable front shading panel. </li>
<li>Ability to control internal humidity with discrete fans that circulate the air inside. </li>
<li>Ability to control the temperature using a combination of the fan and the shade. </li>
<li>A barrier to surrounding wildlife that may interfere with the growth of especially saplings. </li>
<li>Remote controlled adjustments from your phone, for those who are often away from their gardens.</li>
</ul>

<h6> Prototyping our final solution: </h6>
<p>The best thing about these kinds of interdisciplinary courses is each team’s access to a wide range of experiences and skills. We were lucky enough to have a mechanical engineer on our team, who led the way during the 3D modeling and printing process.
    <br><br>
    We then smoothed and spray painted our 3D model, and used shades, laminate, and lots of super glue to arrive at our final prototype.We wanted to make sure our product had the right shape and size for the average small-scale plant. We also wanted to make sure we had easily removable panels in case the plant inside is a fruit or herb, and requires easy access form time to time.</p> <br>

<h6> The final product: </h6>    
    
  <b>Our solution finalized as Inku, the smart small greenhouse.</b>
Inku adapts to the environment around it by controlling sunlight, humidity, temperature, and watering, creating the perfect environment for whatever you choose to grow. Our physical product pairs with a mobile application for easy access to and increased understanding of your garden plants.

<h6> Refelctions: </h6>    
I wish we had more time to implement rather than just ideating on IoT features! Had this not been a 5-week assignment followed by a full semester of more project courses, we would have used an Arduino to enable a few connections to a mobile phone. <br><br> One of my biggest takeaways was that you don't have to be an engineer to prototype and test a new product or an idea. We were able to put our super-glue and laminate model to the test and manually roll the shades up and down, since no real IoT was implemented. This way, you can gather feedback on the product without investing too much time or resources and make efficient, insightful changes to your model.
